This is a simple repo that demonstrates how to create a RecyclerView for your application.  
The project contains two modules:
* app: Kotlin version of the code
* java: Java version of the code.

A thorough explanation for the code can be found in the post [here](http://mobiledevhub.com/2018/07/19/android-recyclerview-overview/).  
Feel free to contact me in case you have any suggestions/comments/feedback for improvement.
